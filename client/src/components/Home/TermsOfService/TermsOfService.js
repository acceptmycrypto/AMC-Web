                    qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and

                    <li className="Terms-listItem">
                      Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
                      Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge
                      or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very
                      limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages
                      and relief on an individual basis that a court can award
                      to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of
                      the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for
                      the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to
                      arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this
                      Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1
                      of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and
                      Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"),
                      shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.

                      procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules
                      (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to

                      prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an
                      arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the
